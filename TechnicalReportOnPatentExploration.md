# TECHNICAL REPORT ON PATENT EXPLORATION

<p>The patent that has been chosen is for some memory modules and systems, directly stated to have high performance and capacity. The patent was filed in May of 2020, submitted by Rambus Inc, and finalized back in 2022.</p>

<p>A memory module, more commonly known as RAM, is responsible for temporary storage on the CPU. They heavily rely on speed and capacity to function properly, and will most often benefit from having a lot of either factor. Higher speeds lead to higher performance; a fast memory speed will allow for processing to be done much faster, meaning that the computer will be able to run much smoother and do more tasks at once. A higher capacity means that more data can be stored and accessed, letting the computer perform tasks or use programs with much higher processing needed.</p>

<p>According to its background, the patent was created out of pure necessity. Personal computers often include, among other things, some type of memory system, which in and of itself commonly includes a memory controller that communicates with memory modules. While there have been many improvements in the memory system over the years, one metric of the system that had shown limited improvements up until that point was the number of modules that can connect to a single channel.</p>

<p>The purpose of the patent is to allow for a channel to have a higher amount of memory modules attached to it; the modules are able to switch between wide-data and narrow-data modes. The former allows collecting memory data to be collected from both sides of the module, while the latter only collects memory data from one of the two sides.</p>
