## CPU Visual Simulator
**URL:** https://learn.ontariotechu.ca/courses/27711/modules/items/640483 

**Summary:** This simulator displays a visualization of the RAM and CPU, with simple examples of calculations they can perform or execute. This program is designed to help any user get a better understanding of how the RAM and CPU work and work together. It even provides a text-to-speech program that reads out the steps as they happen.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The Central Processing Unit and Random Access Memory are integral parts of a computer, and work in tandem to make calculations and decisions for the rest of the computer system.

**Personal Insights:** Being able to visualize how a process works can be a vital tool for any visual learner.

## Visual Transistor Level Simulation of the 6502 CPU (and other chips)
**URL:** http://www.visual6502.org/

**Summary:** This website allows users to examine accurate simulations of Central Processing Units throughout the years. This website was created in an attempt to help users visualize how a CPU chip operates.

**Key Takeaways:**
- A lot more happens in a chip than one might expect; the CPU makes thousands of decisions and calculations in a small period of time.

**Personal Insights:** Never underestimate a person's dedication to their craft.

## emulsiV
**URL:** https://eseo-tech.github.io/emulsiV/

**Summary:** This website is a virtual simulator of an RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer). The program was designed with the explicit purpose of teaching Computer Architecture.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The program counter sends information to the computer's memory, which is converted into data and sent to the instruction registry.
- The registry processes the instructions sent to it and transfers it to the ALU to be conducted alongside some general-purpose data.
- The final product is sent back to the program counter, presumably confirming its completion.

**Personal Insights:**
- This may or may not be how computers work.

## Reflection [As of 7/10/2024]
**Feedback:** While this assignment did nothing to help my previous understanding, it helped me to understand my lack of understanding concepts, as well as my lack of practice in explaining things in detail.

**Reflection:** The process of documenting my learning has made me more aware of what I did and did not know.

## Reflection [As of 7/15/2024]
**Reflection:** Nothing has changed.
