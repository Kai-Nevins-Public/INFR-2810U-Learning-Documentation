SUMMARY: The research paper, “A Survey of Computer Architecture Simulation Techniques and Tools”, is an analysis created by Ayaz Akram and Lina Sawalha of visual simulators for computer processor models. The paper was created as a way to assist those researching computer architecture to select a simulator to use during their research, since there is a clear lack of proper documentation in the world pertaining to this subject. The introduction goes on to explain the main goal of a simulation, as well as explaining the role of the survey itself and what it covers.
